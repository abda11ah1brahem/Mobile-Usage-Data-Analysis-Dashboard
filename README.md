Key features include:
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for creating calculated columns and measures to enable in-depth filtering and custom insights.
- Analysis of app usage by age, gender, and operating system.
- Visualizations comparing battery consumption across top mobile devices.
- Filtering capabilities to explore data trends by device model, operating system, and age group.


This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of mobile usage patterns, helping uncover valuable insights into user behavior and device performance.
